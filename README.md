# Classification Model Evaluation Project

This project provides a framework for evaluating classification models using common metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. It includes a simple implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and utilities for evaluating its performance.

## Project Overview

This project aims to demonstrate best practices in evaluating classification models. It includes:

- A simple SVM implementation for binary classification
- Utility functions for calculating common evaluation metrics
- A main script to load data, train the model, and perform evaluations
- Unit tests for the implemented functions

The project uses scikit-learn for the SVM implementation and numpy for numerical operations. It also includes matplotlib for visualization of results.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/classification-model-evaluation.git
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Project

To run the project:

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd classification-model-evaluation
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment (if not already activated):
   ```
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Run the main script:
   ```
   python src/main.py
   ```

This will load sample data, train the SVM model, and display evaluation metrics.

## Features

- **Simple SVM Implementation**: Uses scikit-learn's SVC for binary classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Calculates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Visualization Tools**: Prints classification report and confusion matrix.
- **Unit Tests**: Includes tests for the implemented functions.

## Usage

The project can be easily extended or modified:

1. To change the classifier, modify the `src/models/model.py` file.
2. To add new evaluation metrics, edit the `src/utils/evaluation_metrics.py` file.
3. To use different datasets, replace the data loading logic in `src/main.py`.
